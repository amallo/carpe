Name: "Smart Commit Message"
Description: "Generate detailed commit message with code analysis"
Prompt: |
  I want you to analyze the staged changes and generate a comprehensive commit message.
  
  Please:
  1. First, analyze what files have been modified and their changes
  2. Determine the type of change (feat, fix, refactor, etc.)
  3. Identify the scope/component affected
  4. Generate a clear, descriptive message
  5. If applicable, suggest additional details for the commit body
  
  Use conventional commit format: type(scope): description
  
  For this analysis, consider:
  - File types changed (components, utils, config, etc.)
  - Nature of changes (new features, bug fixes, improvements)
  - Impact on functionality
  - Breaking changes if any
  
  Please provide:
  ```
  type(scope): description
  ```
  
  And explain your reasoning for the chosen type and scope.
